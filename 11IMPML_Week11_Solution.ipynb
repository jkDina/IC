    "\n",
    "Welcome to the final assignment of this course! At this point, you have learnt about different machine learning algorithms and you have applied each of them to different problems. In this assignment, we will instead use one single data set and try make a prediction by using different algorithms with the goal of deciding which one performs the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading the data set, we will perfom some exploratory data analysis to undertand the relationship between some of the features in the data set. Next, we will extensively manipulate the dataframe to prepare our data for our analysis. We will do so by using techniques such as label encoding, one hot encoding and correlation. Finally, we will apply three different machine learning algorithms to solve our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is designed to help you apply the machine learning algorithms you have learned using packages in Python. Python concepts, instructions, and a starter code are embedded within this Jupyter Notebook to help guide you as you progress through the assignment. Remember to run the code of each code cell prior to submitting the assignment. Upon completing the assignment, we encourage you to compare your work against the solution file to perform a self-assessment.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the past weeks, we have learnt about different machine mearning algorithms that allowed us to analyse and make predictions on different data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have come to end of this course, it is time to compare the performances of some of these algorithms, analyse the results, and discuss the strengths and limitations of each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set that we will be using in this assignment contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. You can find more information about the data set [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to create meaningful estimators from the data set we have and to select the model that predicts the cancellation best by comparing them with the accuracy scores of different machine learning models. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine, the cancellation rate for bookings in the online booking industry is quite high. Once the reservation has been cancelled, there is almost nothing to be done. This may creates discomfort for many hotels and thus creates a necessity to take precautions. Therefore, predicting reservations that can be cancelled and preventing these cancellations can create a positive value for the hotels. "

    "As a first thought, we expected the cancellation rate to be lower in the market segments where deposits are applied. But when we look at the cancellations by market segment, it seems that this is not the case. Deposits were applied to Offline TA/TO and Groups reservations, and not for Direct reservations:\n",

The number of correct and incorrect predictions are summarised with count values and broken down by each class. This is the key to the confusion matrix.
